Robotics

Contents: Written by Brian Lesko, the repository contains Python scripts demonstrating robotics theories largely originating from the book, Modern Robotics, by Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park

Creation of Contents: With comments and figures, the scripts were mainly reproduced from Matlab project submissions for Robotics 7752 with improvements. While some code is built off textbook code, the implementation of theory was mainly reproduced for learning purposes.
