# Demo: Stochastic Gradient Descent for Robotics: Inverse Kinematics
A [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) demo [written in pure Python](https://github.com/BrianLesko/Robotics/blob/main/demo-INVE-KINM-2R/INVE-KINM-2R.py)
to visualize a robot searching for a target end effector location.

Demonstrating numerical inverse kinematics. This simplistic app was rapidly prototyped using streamlit in under 2 days of work by Brian Lesko in September of 2023.  

About me: I started my github in 2022 while studying at Ohio State for my Masters in Mechanical Engineering. I hope you can find my work here useful I want to help others and in the process get better at documenting what I love. If you like my work, go check out some of my other projects and connect with me. Im open to collaborating.
