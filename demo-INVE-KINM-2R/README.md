## Inverse Kinematics

This repository subfolder exists to demonstrate numerical inverse kinematics. This simplistic app was rapidly prototyped using streamlit in under 2 days of work by Brian Lesko in September of 2023.  

Check out the associated web app to this repository subfolder [here](https://robotics-ik-lesko.streamlit.app)

About me: I started my github in 2022 while studying at Ohio State for my Masters in Mechanical Engineering. I hope you can find my work here useful I want to help others and in the process get better at documenting what I love. If you like my work, go check out some of my other projects and connect with me. Im open to collaborating.
